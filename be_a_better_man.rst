If one person knows how he spend his life, he will be in shock:

he spent 8 hours a day at work, only 1-2 hours (even less!) were for the jobs really metters. 
and he lost almost all the time after work: playing game, watch TV, surfing the internet. and so this is a day. 
a day without perception, a day without plan, and it all coursed by a man without knowning what he is doing.

most of us is this man. is is sad. and on the opposite, some great people have causion, 
they know what they what to, and knows it so well that for every minute (or at least when he is planning to do something), 
he can focus on the important things. by doing this, they have better lifes.

so how could we be one of those "great people"? are there anything magical? no. there are some simple rules:

**rule 1: plan before you start.**

we always eager to start doing things right away, it is human nature, our brain works this way: doing things make ourselves feel better.
and planning is hard, make ourselves feel bad. but the issue is: plannig is hard because you don't really know what you starts! 
and without knowing the full picture may lead to failure. so make a plan, it is your road map. without it, you will easily get lost.

** rule 2: start and finish what you plans.**

people controlled by their feelings. things have good part and bad part. we always lost the battle. we always retreat, if we don't have faith.
if planning is like a general, analysis, judges, and make decisions, doing things is like a soldier. not care about how target is hard to accomplish,
only concentrate on finish it.

**rule 3: examine what you finished.**

after finish the job, people just passing through, the job has the feeling of pain, why not folder it, and leave it? 
the reason is, facing the pain, make we do better in the future, and the job is our a reflection of ourselves, 
examine it make ourselves better. so it is important.

those are the simple rules. easy to understand, hard to follow. it need disciprine, it need will power to follow.
there is no easy way, maybe there are some tips that can make it easier, but it still need you to face the problem.

anyway, hope you can follow it, and be a better man.
